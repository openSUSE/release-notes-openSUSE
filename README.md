## Writing

### Preparation
  * Make sure you can explain what is wrong or why a new entry is needed.
  * Before proposing a release notes entry about a concerns a software bug,
    make sure that the software bug itself is reported on Bugzilla.

### Getting the Change In
If you see an issue or want to add an entry, you can contribute in two ways:

* Create a [bug report](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/enter_bug.cgi?&product=openSUSE%20Distribution&component=Release%20Notes&short_desc=[rn]+&assigned_to=sknorr%40suse.com).
  You will need an openSUSE account to do so.
  * Make sure to mention the affected openSUSE version.
  * If you are proposing a new entry, create a draft entry.

* Create a pull request on GitHub. You will need a GitHub account to do so.
  * Edit the file `xml/release-notes.xml` *only*. Language (PO) files are
    edited using [Weblate](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/release-notes-opensuse/)
    and the file `NEWS` is updated only directly before packaging.
  * Make sure to pick the right branch to base your contribution on. `master` is
    used for openSUSE Tumbleweed release notes, `Leap_*` branches are used for
    openSUSE Leap versions. Usually, the default branch will be the current
    development version of openSUSE Leap.
  * If you are writing a new release note which was requested in a Bugzilla
    entry, append the bug number to your Git commit message.
    For example: "Add note on Barfoosation of Frob (boo#12345)"
  * If you are making a larger change which was not requested via Bugzilla,
    add a line containing only an asterisk character (`*`) after the normal
    commit message. This way, the commit message will be picked up for `NEWS`
    and the package change log later.
