   <title>Minimal System Installation</title>
   <para>
    To avoid some big recommended packages from being
    installed, the pattern for minimal installations uses another
    pattern that creates conflicts with undesired packages. This pattern,
    <literal>patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts</literal>,
    can be removed after installation.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that the minimal installation has no firewall by
    default. If you need one, install
    <literal>SuSEfirewall2</literal>.

  <section id="sec.123.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI
    (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to
    check for any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and,
    if available, to install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8
    is a strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.
   </para>

  <section id="sec.123.uefi-part">
   <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of
    partitioning arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema
    uses globally unique identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32
    hexadecimal digits) to identify devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to
    automatically generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write
    them to the firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a
    rewrite in the firmware. A rewrite consists of two different
    operations: Removing the old entry and creating a new entry that
    replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted
    entries and frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem
    arises when faulty firmware does not collect and free those entries.
    This can result in a non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.
