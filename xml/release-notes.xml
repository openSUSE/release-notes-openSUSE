   <title>Minimal System Installation</title>
   <!-- FIXME: Is this still accurate, patterns and all or is this affected
   by decisions made on the SLE side? -->
   <para>
    To avoid some big recommended packages from being installed, the pattern
    for minimal installations uses another pattern that creates conflicts with
    undesired packages. This pattern,
    <literal>patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts</literal>, can be removed
    after installation.

    Note that the minimal installation has no firewall by default. If you need
    one, install <literal>firewalld</literal>.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified
    Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to
    install such an update. A pre-installation of Windows 8 or later is a
    strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.
   </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi-part">
  <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of partitioning
    arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema uses globally unique
    identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32 hexadecimal digits) to identify
    devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to automatically
    generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the
    firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the
    firmware. A rewrite consists of two different operations: Removing the old
    entry and creating a new entry that replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted entries and
    frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem arises when faulty
    firmware does not collect and free those entries. This can result in a
    non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.

   <title><command>systemctl stop apparmor</command> Does Not Work</title>
   <para>
    In the past, there could be confusion over the difference between how the
    very similarly named <command>systemctl</command> subcommands
    <literal>reload</literal> and <literal>restart</literal> worked for
    AppArmor:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <command>systemctl reload apparmor</command> properly reloaded all
      AppArmor profiles. (It was and continues to be the recommended way of
      reloading AppArmor profiles.)
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <command>systemctl restart apparmor</command> meant that
      AppArmor would stop, thereby unloading all AppArmor profiles and then
      restart which left all existing processes unconfined. Only newly
      started processes would then be confined again.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    Unfortunately, <systemitem>systemd</systemitem> does
    not provide a solution within its unit file format for the issue posed
    by the <literal>restart</literal> scenario.
   </para>
   <para>
    Starting with AppArmor 2.12, the command
    <command>systemctl stop apparmor</command> will not work.
    As a consequence, <command>systemctl restart apparmor</command> will now
    correctly reload AppArmor profiles.
   </para>
   <para>
    To unload all AppArmor profiles, use the new command
    <command>aa-teardown</command> instead which matches the previous

   <title>No Default Compose Key Combination</title>
   <para>
    In previous versions of &os;, the compose key combination
    allowed typing characters that were not part of the regular keyboard layout.

    <keycombo><keycap function="shift"/><keycap>Right Ctrl</keycap></keycombo>
    and then press <keycap>a</keycap> twice.
   </para>
   <para>
    In &thisversion;, there is no longer a predefined compose key combination
    because
    <keycombo><keycap function="shift"/><keycap>Right Ctrl</keycap></keycombo>
    does not work as expected anymore.
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To define a system-wide custom compose key combination, use the file
      <filename>/etc/X11/Xmodmap</filename> and look for the following lines:

<screen>[...]
!! Third example: Change right Control key to Compose key.
!! To do Compose Character, press this key and afterwards two
