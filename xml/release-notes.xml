   <title>Using Atomic Updates With the System Role <emphasis>Transactional Server</emphasis></title>
   <!-- boo#1092953, boo#1093098 -->
   <para>
    The installer supports the system role <emphasis>Transactional
    Server</emphasis>. This system role features an update system that
    applies updates atomically (as a single operation) and makes them easy to
    revert should that become necessary.
    These features are based on the package management tools that all
    other &suse; and &osuse; distributions also rely on. This means that the
    vast majority of RPM
    packages that work with other system roles of &thisversion; also work
    with the system role <emphasis>Transactional Server</emphasis>.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Incompatible Packages</title>
    <para>
     Some packages modify the contents of <filename>/var</filename> or
     <filename>/srv</filename> in their RPM <literal>%post</literal> scripts.
     These packages are incompatible. If you find such a package, file a
     bug report.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    To provide these features, this update system relies on:

    <listitem>
     <formalpara>
      <title>Btrfs snapshots</title>
      <para>
       Before a system update is started, a new Btrfs snapshot of the root
       file system is created. Then, all the changes from the update are
       installed into that Btrfs snapshot. To complete the update, you can
       then restart the system into the new snapshot.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>
      To revert the update, simply boot from the previous snapshot instead.

      <title>A read-only root file system</title>
      <para>
       To avoid issues with and data loss because of updates, the root file

       system is mounted read-only during normal operation.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>
      To make this setup work, two additional changes to the file system
      needed to be made: To allow writing user configuration in
      <filename>/etc</filename>, this directory is automatically configured
      to use OverlayFS. <filename>/var</filename> is now a separate subvolume
      which can be written to by processes.

    <title><emphasis>Transactional Server</emphasis> Needs At Least 12 GB of Disk Space</title>
    <para>
     The system role <emphasis>Transactional Server</emphasis> needs a disk
     size of at least 12 GB to accommodate Btrfs snapshots.

    To work with transactional updates, always use the command

     <para>
      To revert the last snapshot, that is the last set of changes to the
      root file system, make sure your system is booted into the next to last
      snapshot and run:
      <command>transactional-update rollback</command>
     </para>
     <para>
      Optionally, add a snapshot ID to the end of the command to rollback to
      a specific ID.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    When using this system role, by default, the system will perform a daily
    update and reboot between 03:30 am and 05:00 am. Both of these actions
    are systemd-based and if necessary can be disabled using
    <command>systemctl</command>:

   <title>Installing on Hard Disks With Less Than 12 GB of Capacity</title>

   <para>
    The installer will only propose a partitioning scheme if the available
    hard disk size is larger than 12 GB. If you want to set up, for example,
    very small virtual machines images, use the guided partitioner to tune
    partitioning parameters manually.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified
    Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to
    install such an update. A pre-installation of Windows 8 or later is a
    strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.
   </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi-part">
  <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of partitioning
    arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema uses globally unique
    identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32 hexadecimal digits) to identify
    devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to automatically
    generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the
    firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the
    firmware. A rewrite consists of two different operations: Removing the old
    entry and creating a new entry that replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted entries and
    frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem arises when faulty
    firmware does not collect and free those entries. This can result in a
    non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.

   <title>Secure Boot: Third-Party Drivers Need to Be Properly Signed</title>
   <para>
    &thisflavor; 15.2 now enables a kernel
    module signature check for third-party drivers
    (<literal>CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y</literal>). This is an important
    security measure to avoid untrusted code running in the kernel.
   </para>
   <para>
    This may prevent third-party
    kernel modules from being loaded if UEFI Secure Boot is enabled.
    Kernel Module Packages (KMPs) from the official &osuse; repositories
    are not affected, because the modules they contain are signed with
    the openSUSE key. The signature check has the following behavior:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Kernel modules that are unsigned or signed with a key that is either
      known as untrusted or cannot be verified against the system's trusted
      key data base will be blocked.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
     It is possible to generate a custom certificate, enroll it
     into the system's Machine Owner Key (MOK) data base,
     and sign locally compiled kernel modules with this certificate's key.
     Modules signed in this manner will neither be blocked nor cause warnings.
     See <link xlink:href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Since this also affects NVIDIA graphics drivers, we addressed this in our
    official packages for openSUSE. However, you need to manually enroll a new
    MOK key after installation to make the new packages work.
