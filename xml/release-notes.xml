   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing openSUSE on a system that boots using UEFI
    (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to
    check for any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and,
    if available, to install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8
    is a strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that
    cause it to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage
    area. Nobody really knows how much "too much" is, though.  openSUSE
    minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS.  The minimum means telling the UEFI
    firmware about the location of the openSUSE boot loader.  Upstream
    Linux Kernel features that use the UEFI storage area for storing
    boot and crash information (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been
    disabled by default. Nevertheless, it is recommended to install any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends.

   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of
    partitioning arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema
    uses globally unique identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32
    hexadecimal digits) to identify devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB2) try to
    automatically generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write
    them to the firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a
    rewrite in the firmware. A rewrite consist of two different
    operation: removing the old entry and creating a new entry that
    replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted
    entries and frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem
    arises when faulty firmware does not collect and free those entries;
    this may end up with a non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    The workaround is simple: convert the legacy MBR partition to the
    new GPT to avoid this problem completely.

          <para>The network printer discovery protocol has changed.
           The native method to discover network printers
           is now based on DNS Service discovery (DNS-SD, ie via
           Avahi).
           The <literal>cups-browsed</literal> service from the
           <literal>cups-filters</literal> package can be used to
           bridge old and new protocols. Both
           <literal>cupsd</literal> and
           <literal>cups-browsed</literal> need to run to make
