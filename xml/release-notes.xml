   <title>Live CD Installer and Keyboard Settings</title>
   <para>
    The Live CD installer presents a problem related with the keyboard
    settings.  If the user changes from the QWERTY keyboard layout (the
    default en-US variant), this setting will not be properly applied,
    and the new system will stay with a QWERTY pre-configuration.
   </para>
   <para>
    As a workaround, use the <command>localectl</command> command-line
    tool after the installation. For example (to install a German
    keyboard layout):

  <section id="sec.123.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing openSUSE on a system that boots using UEFI
    (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to
    check for any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and,
    if available, to install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8
    is a strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that
    cause it to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage
    area. Nobody really knows how much "too much" is, though.  openSUSE
    minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS.  The minimum means telling the UEFI
    firmware about the location of the openSUSE boot loader.  Upstream
    Linux Kernel features that use the UEFI storage area for storing
    boot and crash information (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been
    disabled by default. Nevertheless, it is recommended to install any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends.
   </para>
  </section>


  <section id="sec.123.uefi-part">
   <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of
    partitioning arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema
    uses globally unique identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32
    hexadecimal digits) to identify devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB2) try to
    automatically generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write
    them to the firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a
    rewrite in the firmware. A rewrite consist of two different
    operation: removing the old entry and creating a new entry that
    replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted
    entries and frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem
    arises when faulty firmware does not collect and free those entries;
    this may end up with a non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    The workaround is simple: convert the legacy MBR partition to the
    new GPT to avoid this problem completely.
   </para>

   <title>Booting When in Secure Boot Mode</title>
   <para>
    This only affects machines in UEFI mode with secure boot enabled.
   </para>
   <para>
    The new version of the shim loader allows more machines to boot with
    Secure Boot enabled than with openSUSE 13.1. Nevertheless, in case
    of trouble, first update the BIOS of your machine to the latest
    version. If the BIOS update does not help, report the model of your
    machine to the wiki (http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI). Then we
    can track it for the next release.

   <title>Garbage on the Screen During Installation with the Nouveau Driver</title>
   <para>
    On some systems with NVIDIA cards, the installer may show garbage on
    the top part of the screen due to problems with the default nouveau
    driver. If you are affected by this problem, you can disable the
    nouveau kernel module to run the installer and then enable it again
    once the system is installed or upgraded.
   </para>
   <para>
    To disable the kernel module, once you boot from the installation
    media, select the 'Installation' entry in grub and press 'e' to edit
    the parameters. Then go to the line starting with 'linux' (or
    'linuxefi') and add <literal>brokenmodules=nouveau</literal> at the
    end. Now press F10 to continue booting with the new parameter. After
    the system is installed, you can re-enable the nouveau module by
    editing <filename>/etc/modprobe.d/50-blacklist.conf</filename> and
    removing the entry that blacklists nouveau.
