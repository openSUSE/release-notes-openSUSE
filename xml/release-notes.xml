   <title>Minimal System Installation</title>
   <para>
    To avoid some big recommended packages from being installed, the pattern
    for minimal installations uses another pattern that creates conflicts with
    undesired packages. This pattern,
    <literal>patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts</literal>, can be removed
    after installation.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that the minimal installation has no firewall by default. If you need
    one, install <literal>SuSEfirewall2</literal>.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified
    Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to
    install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8 is a strong indication
    that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi-part">
  <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of partitioning
    arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema uses globally unique
    identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32 hexadecimal digits) to identify
    devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to automatically
    generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the
    firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the
    firmware. A rewrite consists of two different operations: Removing the old
    entry and creating a new entry that replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted entries and
    frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem arises when faulty
    firmware does not collect and free those entries. This can result in a
    non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.

   <title>Nouveau 3D/DRI Driver May Crash KDE Applications</title>
   <para>
    With &thisversion;, the Nouveau Mesa/DRI driver for 2D/3D
    rendering is considered experimental. The Nouveau kernel/KMS
    driver and the Nouveau X.org/DDX driver for 2D rendering are
    still considered stable.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the Nouveau Mesa/DRI driver is in use, some applications may crash,

    in case of problems.

    Without this driver installed, there is no hardware 3D acceleration support
    on any Nvidia GPU and no 2D acceleration on newer Nvidia GPUs
    that use Glamor for fast 2D operations. Kernel Mode Setting and

    <para>
     <filename>/var/cache</filename> contains a lot of very volatile data, such
