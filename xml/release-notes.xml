   <title>Minimal System Installation</title>
   <para>
    To avoid some big recommended packages from being
    installed, the pattern for minimal installations uses another
    pattern that creates conflicts with undesired packages. This pattern,
    <literal>patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts</literal>,
    can be removed after installation.

   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI
    (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to
    check for any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and,
    if available, to install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8
    is a strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.

   <para>
    When setting the default mount value to

    report an error and crash. As a workaround, use another option for
    installation. If needed, switch back to <guimenu>By Label</guimenu> on

   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of
    partitioning arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema
    uses globally unique identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32
    hexadecimal digits) to identify devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to
    automatically generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write
    them to the firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a
    rewrite in the firmware. A rewrite consists of two different
    operations: Removing the old entry and creating a new entry that
    replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted
    entries and frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem
    arises when faulty firmware does not collect and free those entries.
    This can result in a non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.

   <title>Nouveau 3D/DRI Driver May Crash KDE Applications</title>
   <para>
    With &opensuseleap; &version;, the Nouveau Mesa/DRI driver for 2D/3D
    rendering is considered experimental. The Nouveau kernel/KMS
    driver and the Nouveau X.org/DDX driver for 2D rendering are
    still considered stable.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the Nouveau Mesa/DRI driver is in use, some applications may crash,
    especially KDE and Qt applications. The driver is now in a separate
    package called <package>Mesa-dri-nouveau</package>, which can be removed
    in case of problems.

   <para>
    Without this driver installed, there is no hardware 3D acceleration support
    on any Nvidia GPU and no 2D acceleration on newer Nvidia GPUs
    that use Glamor for fast 2D operations. Kernel Mode Setting and
    basic 2D are still available, as is 2D acceleration via EXA on
    GPUs from the Nvidia GPU generation code-named Kepler

    <title><filename>/var/cache</filename> on an Own Subvolume for Snapshots and Rollback</title>
    <para>
     <filename>/var/cache</filename> contains a lot of very volatile data, such
     as the Zypper cache with RPM packages in different versions for each
     update. As a result of storing data that is mostly redundant but highly
     volatile, the amount of disk space a snapshot occupies can increase very
     fast.
    </para>
    <para>
     To solve this, move <filename>/var/cache</filename> to a separate
     subvolume. On fresh installations of &opensuseleap; &version;, this is
     done automatically. To convert an existing root file system, perform the
     following steps:

    <emphasis role="bold">CUPS Version Upgrade to 1.7</emphasis>
   </para>
   <para>
    Compared to CUPS 1.5 in &opensuse; 13.2 CUPS 1.7 introduced some
    major changes that may require manual configuration adjustments.
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      PDF is now the standard print job format rather than PS.
      Therefore traditional PostScript printers now also need a
      filter driver for printing.
     </para>
     <para>
      See
      <link xlink:href="https://en.opensuse.org/Concepts_printing"/>
      for details.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The network printer discovery protocol has changed.
      The native method to discover network printers is now based on DNS Service
      discovery (DNS-SD, that is, via Avahi).
      The <literal>cups-browsed</literal> service from the
      <literal>cups-filters</literal> package can be used to bridge old and new
      protocols. Both <literal>cupsd</literal> and
      <literal>cups-browsed</literal> need to run to make "legacy" clients
      discover printers (that includes LibreOffice and KDE).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para> The IPP protocol default version changed from 1.1
      to 2.0. Older IPP servers like CUPS 1.3.x (for example in
      &sle; 11) reject IPP 2.0 requests with <literal>Bad Request</literal> (see
      <link xlink:href="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4231"/>).
     </para>

     <para>
      To be able to print to old servers, the IPP protocol version must be
      specified explictly by appending <literal>/version=1.1</literal> to either:
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The <literal>ServerName</literal> settings in
        <literal>client.conf</literal> (for example,
        <literal>ServerName older.server.example.com/version=1.1</literal>).
       </para>

        The <literal>CUPS_SERVER</literal> environment variable value.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        The server name value of the <literal>-h</literal> option of the
        command line tools, for example:
       </para>
        <screen>lpstat -h older.server.example.com/version=1.1 -p</screen>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Some printing filters and back-ends were moved from the
      <literal>cups</literal> package to the <literal>cups-filters</literal>
      package.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para> Some configuration directives were split from <literal>cupsd.conf</literal>
      into <literal>cups-files.conf</literal>
      (see
      <link xlink:href="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4223"/>,
      CVE-2012-5519, and

     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>CUPS banners and the CUPS test page were moved from
      the <literal>cups</literal> package to the

      <title>KDE Software for Personal Information Management (KDE PIM)</title>
      <para>
          &opensuseleap; &version; ships two versions of the KDE PIM
          (Kontact, KMail, etc.) suite:

         The version based on KDE Frameworks 5
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
          KDE PIM 4.x is no longer supported by upstream KDE, but was
          kept to avoid disrupting user workflows.
      </para>
      <para>
          The two versions of KDE PIM are not co-installable. Some software, such as
          KNode (package <package>knode</package>) require the legacy 4.x
          version and will be uninstalled when installing any package from
          KDE PIM 5.x (for example, the package <package>kmail5</package>).
      </para>
      <para>
          KDE PIM 4.x will be removed in the next version of &opensuseleap;.
          Therefore, you are encouraged to switch to the newer 5.x version.
      </para>
      <para>
          However, not all settings are migrated from the older version at
          this time. For more information, see the bug report at

    The version of the KDE file manager Dolphin that is shipped with
    &opensuseleap; &version; cannot set
    <quote>Extended Permission</quote> bits (GID,
