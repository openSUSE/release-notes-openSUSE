   <title>Minimal System Installation</title>
   <para>
    To avoid some big recommended packages from being installed, the pattern
    for minimal installations uses another pattern that creates conflicts with
    undesired packages. This pattern,
    <literal>patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts</literal>, can be removed
    after installation.
   </para>

    Note that the minimal installation has no firewall by default. If you need
    one, install <literal>SuSEfirewall2</literal>.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing &opensuse; on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified
    Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to
    install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8 is a strong indication
    that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it
    to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. However,
    there is no clear data of how much is <quote>too much</quote>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &opensuse; minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about
    the location of the &opensuse; boot loader. Upstream Linux kernel features
    that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information
    (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it
    is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor
    recommends.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.install.uefi-part">
  <!-- bnc#850056 -->
   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of partitioning
    arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema uses globally unique
    identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32 hexadecimal digits) to identify
    devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB 2) try to automatically
    generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the
    firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the
    firmware. A rewrite consists of two different operations: Removing the old
    entry and creating a new entry that replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted entries and
    frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem arises when faulty
    firmware does not collect and free those entries. This can result in a
    non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To work around this problem, convert the legacy MBR partition to GPT.

    <para>
     <filename>/var/cache</filename> contains a lot of very volatile data, such

    <title>AArch64: Page Size Has Been Changed From &opensuseleap; 42.1 to &thisversion;</title>
    <para>
     In &opensuseleap; 42.1, the default page size on AArch64 platforms was 64
     kB. With &thisversion;, the page size has been changed to 4 kB. This
     renders old Swap and Btrfs file systems unusable.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are currently on &opensuseleap; 42.1 on AArch64, consider a fresh
     installation of &thisversion; instead of upgrading.

    <title>Systems with CCISS Controllers Can Fail to Boot After Upgrade</title>
    <para>
     The driver for Compaq/HP Smart Array (CCISS) controllers
     (<filename>cciss.ko</filename>) does not support certain controllers
     anymore by default. This can lead to the root disk not being detected by
     the &thisversion; kernel.

     On affected systems, the CCISS driver can be configured to revert to the
